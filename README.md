# Sentiment_Analysis
This project implements a sentiment analysis model to classify text data into positive, negative, or neutral categories. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the model uses [mention any specific libraries or frameworks you used, e.g., NLTK, spaCy, or transformers] for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and sentiment classification. The project includes:

    Data preprocessing and cleaning
    Feature extraction using [e.g., TF-IDF, word embeddings]
    Model training and evaluation
    Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

The repository includes code, datasets, and instructions for running the sentiment analysis pipeline.
